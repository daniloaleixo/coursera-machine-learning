## Multivariate Linear Regression

### Multiple Features

Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as "multivariate linear regression".
We now introduce notation for equations where we can have any number of input variables.

* x<sup>(i)</sup><sub>j</sub> = value of feature j in the i<sup>th</sup> training example
* x<sup>(i)</sup> = the input (features) of the i<sup>th</sup> training example
* m = the number of training examples=the number of features
* n = the number of features

The multivariable form of the hypothesis function accommodating these multiple features is as follows:

h<sub>θ</sub>(x) = θ<sub>0</sub> + θ<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + θ<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + ... + θ<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub>
